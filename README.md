-------------------------------------------

brass-knuckles provides many efficient and well-tested [data structures][]:

From the basics:
- `Stack`
- `Queue`
- `LinkedList`
- `OrderedLinkedList`
- `DoublyLinkedList`



[Search trees][] (The trees follow the 'leaf tree' model; all data is stored in the leaf nodes of the tree):
- `LeafTree` (which defines the base class on which most of the trees are based)
- `MultiLeafTree` (which is a subclass of `LeafTree` that defines the base class for trees
that allow duplicate value insertions for a single key)


[Balanced search trees][] (with `O(logN)` performance on insertion, search and deletion):
- `WeightBalancedLeafTree`
- `HeightBalancedLeafTree`
- `abTree` (a type of [BTree][])
- `rbTree` (a [red black tree][])
- `FingerTree`
- `SplayTree`
- `SkipList`

Balanced search trees that allow duplicate value insertion:
- `WeightBalancedMultiLeafTree`
- `HeightBalancedMultiLeafTree`

Interval Trees
- `IntervalTree`
- `SegmentTree`
- `orTree` (Orthogonal Range Tree)
- `hdSegmentTree` (Higher-Dimensional Segment Tree)
- `kdTree`

[Heaps][]:
- `Heap`
- `HeapOrderedTree`
- `halfOrderedTree`
- `LeftistHeap`
- `SkewHeap`
- `BinomialHeap`
- `FibonacciHeap`
- `DoubleEndedHeap`
- `MultidimensionalHeap`

String Structures:
- `Trie`
- `Dictionary`
- `SuffixTree`
- `SuffixArray`

[Hash Tables][]:
- `HashTable`
- `HashTree`
- `BloomFilter`
